# Patient's Condition Classification Using Drug Reviews

### Objective
Created a model to analyze patient reviews and classify medical conditions to recommend the most effective drugs.

### Approach
Applied NLP techniques (TF-IDF) to preprocess and vectorize text data.  
Built models like Random Forest, KNN, XGBM, LGBM, and SVM for prediction.  
Deployed using Flask for real-time condition classification.

### Outcome
Provided accurate predictions and user-friendly drug recommendations.
